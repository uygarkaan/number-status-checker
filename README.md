# Number Status Checker

This project demonstrates how to use conditional statements in Java to categorize a person's age into different life stages and handle invalid inputs.

## Features:
- **Age Categorization:** 
  - The program categorizes ages into the following groups:
    - `< 0 years`: "Invalid age"
    - `0 - 1 years`: "baby"
    - `2 - 12 years`: "child"
    - `13 - 17 years`: "teenager"
    - `18 - 64 years`: "adult"
    - `65 and above`: "old"
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Detects and handles negative age inputs by displaying "Invalid age."

## Code Breakdown:
- An integer variable `age` is defined, which can be modified to test different age scenarios.
- The `if-else` structure is used to evaluate the `age` variable and print the corresponding category or an error message.

## Usage:
This program serves as a straightforward example of how to implement conditional logic in Java based on user-defined input values.

## Example Output:
```java
int age = 20; 
// Output: adult
```
